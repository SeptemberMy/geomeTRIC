# 1) The symbol $freeze, $set, $scan specifies the kind of
# constraint for the degrees of freedom on the following lines. 
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# $freeze : The following degrees of freedom should not move from their initial positions
# $set    : The following degrees of freedom are set equal to the value provided
# $scan   : The following degrees of freedom are scanned from A to B in C steps. 
#           If more degrees of freedom are present in $scan, then a multidimensional scan is performed.
# 
# 2) The constrained degrees of freedom follow the special symbols.
# Use one of the following and provide the needed information:
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# x, y, z, xy, xz, yz, xyz : The indicated Cartesian coordinates are constrained.
# -> If in $freeze, provide 1 number for the index of the atom,
#    -or- a range of atoms using commas and dashes but *no spaces*
#         (i.e. 5-7,17,25 maps to 5,6,7,17,25),
#    -or- an atomic symbol to select all atoms that match the symbol.
# -> If in $set, provide the atom selection as above, 
#    -and- 1-3 numbers for the values that the coordinates are set to.
#    The coordinates of each atom in the selection will be set.
#    Warning: Do not set all three coordinates of more than one atom.
# -> If in $scan, provide the atom selection as above,
#    -and- 1-3 for the starting (x,y,z) coordinates,
#    -and- 1-3 for the ending (x,y,z) coordinates,
#    -and- 1 number for the total number of steps including the endpoints.
#    The coordinates of each atom in the selection will be scanned.
# 
# trans-x, trans-y, trans-z, trans-xy, trans-xz, trans-yz, trans-xyz : 
#    The overall translation of the atom selection is constrained.
# -> If in $freeze, provide 1 number for the index of the atom,
#    -or- a range of atoms using commas and dashes but *no spaces*
#         (i.e. 5-7,17,25 maps to 5,6,7,17,25),
#    -or- an atomic symbol to select all atoms that match the symbol.
# -> If in $set, provide the atom selection as above, 
#    -and- 1-3 numbers for the values that the coordinates are set to.
# -> If in $scan, provide the atom selection as above,
#    -and- 1-3 for the starting (x,y,z) coordinates,
#    -and- 1-3 for the ending (x,y,z) coordinates,
#    -and- 1 number for the total number of steps including the endpoints.
# 
# distance : The indicated distance is constrained.
#            Provide 2 numbers for the atomic indices.
# -> If in $set, add 1 number for the value that the distance is set to.
# -> If in $scan, add 2 numbers for the starting and ending values
#    -and- 1 number for the total number of steps including the endpoints.
#
# angle : The indicated angle is constrained.
#         Provide 3 atomic indices; the second atom is the center.
# -> If in $set, add 1 number for the value that the distance is set to.
# -> If in $scan, add 2 numbers for the starting and ending values of the distance
#    -and- 1 number for the total number of steps including the endpoints.
# 
# dihedral : The indicated dihedral angle is constrained.
#            Provide 4 atomic indices; the dihedral angle is defined 
#            as the angle between planes A-B-C and B-C-D where
#            B is the lower number of the two middle atoms, 
#            A is the atom bonded to B, and D is the atom bonded to C.
# 
#  Provide 3 (resp. 4) numbers for the atomic indices.
#  For angles A-B-C, the second atom is the center atom.
#  Dihedral angles are defined as the angle between planes A-B-C and B-C-D
#  where B is the lower number of the two middle atoms.
